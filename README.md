## I. Info

This project visualizes how sorting algorithms work. The program includes:

🔹 bubble sort,

🔹 bucket sort - with insertion sort,

🔹 counting sort,

🔹 gnome sort,

🔹 heap sort,

🔹 insertion sort,

🔹 merge sort,

🔹 quick sort,

🔹 radix sort,

🔹 selection sort.


Settings are stored in settings.txt. There is no explanation of how the algorithms work. If you want to know theory behind it skip to references and sources.
## II. Why bother at all?
Anyone can say "I'll use the std::sort() function and forget about sorting". The more curious will ask "can my program run faster"? This is a difficult question because it consists of many aspects - code language, use of loops, etc. It also includes data sorting. In this area comes Big O notation and many algorithms that run fast and slow according to Big O.

In my software, I show how you can imagine sorting algorithms. You can manipulate the number of elements to be sorted, the resolution and other parameters.

You can see how fast these algorithms work.
## III. Installation and instruction
Download the .zip and you are ready to go. Adjust the settings to your preferences and run "Sorting Algorithms Visualizer.exe".

#### If the program crashes during sorting, try running "Sorting Algorithms Visualizer.exe" in Windows 7 compatibility mode.

Close the cmd window to exit the program.
